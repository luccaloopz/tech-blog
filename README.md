## **Description**
The purpose of this project was to create a full stack application. The website is a technology blog that allows users to create and publish posts for all viewers of the website to see. A user may view other users posts, however, in order leave a comment on another user's post or to view all of their current posts they must first be logged into their account. If they don't have an account they may sign up to create one.
